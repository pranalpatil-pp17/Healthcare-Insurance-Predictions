# **Healthcare-Insurance-Predictions** 🌟

Welcome to my project on predicting medical insurance charges! 🏥💸 This dataset contains information about personal attributes such as **age**, **gender**, **BMI**, **smoking habits**, and **family size**, as well as **geographic factors** and their impact on healthcare expenses. The goal is to build predictive models to understand how these features influence medical insurance costs and help in estimating future healthcare expenses. 🚑📊

Key features in this dataset include:
- **Age**: The insured person's age
- **Sex**: Gender (male or female)
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index
- **Children**: Number of dependents
- **Smoker**: Whether the insured is a smoker (yes or no)
- **Region**: Geographic region of the insured person
- **Charges**: Medical insurance charges incurred by the insured person
